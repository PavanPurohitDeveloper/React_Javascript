> git remote -v // tells which folder you have put code in.

npmjs -- There are more than 12 lac packages available. search react
https://www.npmjs.com/search?q=react
These packages refer to your code/appln library/someone else has written which we can consume.
Around 1,14,458 packages found for react.. Every language they have packages..
These packages are opensource.. 

//Local package or Dependency Or node_modules ( node_modules is folder name)
That particular folder is referred for one application.
90% packages will go locally.
local package is particular to the folder.

//Global package
Global packages are Installed in system.. These packages are system packages.. I can use for every application.
Global can be used for any folder.
only 10% packages will go globally. Global Packages that helps us to :
> To setup.
> To Run the appln.
> To Build the appln.

/*****************************
Steps to Install local package
******************************
1. Must install Nodejs.
Step1# Create package.json file in the folder -- OneTime exercise
Step 2# Navigate to the folder where you want to install using cmd/terminal
Step 3# Write npm install <packagename> Or npm i <packagename> Or npm i <packagename> --save
Or npm i <packagename> --save-dev


> npm install zone.js --> It went to the npm repository and searched for zone.js package 
						  and installed code to our folder called node_modules.
	 In package.json file , by defauly automatically it add the dependencies for zone.js

> npm install react
If you install one, you get other packages installed.. those are called internal dependencies..

==> package-lock.json --> is an informative file..conatins child dependencies..
						  All those packages which are coming as a child dependencies will be there..
						  If you dont have this file also appln will run still..
						  
==> zone.js and react are parent dependencies and rest are child dependencies..
==> Main dependencies will be part of package.json file..
==> When you push the code to github alos, you will not push the node_modules folder also..
	we never push node_modules folder to GIT.
	
> npm install --> It automatically will go to package.json file and downloaded all the packages for you 
		inside node_modules folder. Based on whatever you specified in dependencies inside package.json file
     If the dependencies are part of package.json then  automatically install all the packages for you inside node_modules folder.

How to manage versions:?
-----------------------------		
 "dependencies": {
    "react": "^16.12.0",
    "zone.js": "^0.10.2"
  }
 
"react": "^16.12.0"  --> when we use capsymbol, It always check for the latest version. It will do major updates.
"react": "16.12.0"  ---> Its going to install exact this version always. We always go with static package version..
"react": "~16.12.0"  ---> If you use tild icon, 16. something will be installed whatever latest version. It will not install 17 version.

If you want to install specific version of package ?
---------------------------------------------------
npm install react@16.1.1 --> It will install this version only
npm install react --> It will install latest version.

/*****************************
Steps to Install Global package
******************************
Its going to install in system node_modules folder.
The installed package will not appear in the package.json
*** Global dependencies/package will not be part of package.json.
Those packages you need system access to install globally.
For production you dont need globally packages.

## For windows
Step1 - Run cmd as administrator.
Step2 - npm install -g <package_name>     ( -g stands for global )
		Ex: npm install -g @aakashdeveloper/create-node-app
		
## For Mac/Linux/Unix
Step1 - Open terminal
Step2 - sudo npm install -g @aakashdeveloper/create-node-app

==> mention in Readme.md file --> Install global package. but you never add that in the package.json

## For Win
//one time run//
Step1 - Run cmd as administrator.
Step2 - npm install -g create-react-app ( Install the global package )

//Next all time
Step3 - Navigate to the folder where you want to create an application using cmd/terminal.
Step4 - create-react-app <appname>
Step5 - cd <appname>
Step6 - npm start ( It automatically start the appln and open the browser on port 3000 )

Ex:
> create-react-app firstapp
  Very first file it generates package.json file
  It installing the packages for us automatically.
  you see folders like -- node_modules, public, src, package.json
